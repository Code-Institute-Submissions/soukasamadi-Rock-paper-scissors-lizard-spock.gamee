## User Experience - UX

### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build an easy app for the users to play the game.
2. Build a game that is enjoyable for the players.
   
* As Player, I want to:

1. Be able to understand the purpose of the App and start a new game.
2. Be able to follow the score.
3. Be able to see the computer choices.


## Design

#### Colours
* The colours in the game are supplied by the Python Colorama Model.

### Flowcharts 
![Flowcharts](https://github.com/soukasamadi/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock.game/assets/131408125/ce5c25a0-1f80-4585-a602-7d9b3d7ec0d3)
I spent time planning and thinking about the logic and flow behind the game to ensure I had a general idea of how it could be built. I created flowcharts to assist me with the logical flow throughout the application. The charts were generated using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) Integration and are shown below.<br>

## Testing

### PEP 8 

The [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) pycodestyle was used to validate every Python file in the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

* No errors or warnings were found during the testing of the code in PEP8 but in the run page I got some whitelines errors because of the ASCII Logo.
